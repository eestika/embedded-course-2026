# Embedded Course 2026

This repository contains my study materials, notes, and hands-on exercises
from a professional **Embedded Software Development** course (C / C++)
attended in **2026**.

The goal of this repository is to consolidate embedded fundamentals,
connect theory to real hardware, and build a solid base for professional
embedded systems development.
